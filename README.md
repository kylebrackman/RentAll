# RentAll
RentAll is an application where users can rent out various types of gear, games, or hardware, that others may just need for a few days, or just want to test out! Currently, to rent outdoor gear, one must go to a large, corporate, recreational store to rent out low quality equipment for too high of prices. Now, users can rent out their gear to whoever may need it!

## How RentAll is Written.
RentAll is written using a React front end and a Ruby on Rails back end.

- multiple photo uploads for each item
- password minimum requirements and reset options
- improved css for mobile
